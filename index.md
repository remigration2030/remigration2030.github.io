## Our Goal
In recent years, European societies grappled with considerable challenges due to **mass migration** from Africa and the Middle East. We seek to **empower the European voter** with accurate information, fostering an understanding of the impact on national security, cultural cohesion, and economic stability, and supporting policy decisions that prioritize the well-being of our communities.

We condemn all forms hatred and violence.
